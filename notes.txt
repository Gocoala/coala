# vim: wrap spell

During development
------------------

Open two terminal windows. Both terminals have select the website directory.
Terminal 1: jekyll s --host 0.0.0.0
Terminal 2: compass w

Point a browser window to localhost:4000

Each page has a built automatic refresh feautre. You can enable that by adding ?refresh to the url in the browser. eg: http://localhost/index.html?refresh
This will then refresh the page every 2 seconds by itself without you manually having to refresh the page in the browser.
Note then when you click a link in your page, you will have to re-add ?refresh to get the refresh feature back.


Git
---

Committing changes using git.
The following does *NOT* move files to the actual website because the local git version is linked to the in-house staging server and not to the remote website, but it moves your changes to the local git repository that is used for staging in-house.
Once the version on the staging server is ready for publishing, the website will be published from there.
Using another terminal, make website the working directory.

Make sure you're in the website directory in the terminal.
git commit -a -m "insert a comment here that describes what the changes are about"
git push
