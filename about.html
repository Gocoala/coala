<h2>About Me</h2>
I am a passionate mature graphic designer and a mother of two young boys who are 8 and 5. When I am not designing and creating, you can usually find me getting together with family and friends. I love social gatherings, entertaining, great food, music, swimming, and the outdoors. I can make awesome delicious curry dishes and I can tell the difference between turmeric and saffron.

I had the opportunity to see the industry evolve over several years throughout my entrepreneurial career.
Part of my upbringing is the graphic design program at Algonquin College.
