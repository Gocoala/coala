<h2>About Me</h2>
I am inspired every day by the people and places that surround our daily lives. I have an intense curiosity about the world around us and strive to innovate and solve problems.
<br>
As a mature student and soon to be graduate of the prestigious graphic design program at Algonquin College. I have had the opportunity to see this industry evolve and change over several years through my entrepreneurial background and studies at Algonquin. As technology advances and new business needs are identified, the graphic design and tech industries have had to adapt with it.
<br>
I am passionate about design and research. I look forward to applying traditional design methodologies and principles to developing solid brand identities that businesses can use. I am also keen on strengthening my knowledge in the UI/UX field as this is an ever growing facet of the design industry that I am keenly interested in.
<br>
Some projects that I am currently working on include app and game development. Check back here for updates.
<br>
If you like what you see. Get in touch.

â€“ Nicole
